\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{Basics}

This is text. This is \textbf{bold} text. This is text with \emph{emphasis}. This is ``double quotes". 

Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines. 

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Math \& Citations}	% "&" is a special character
Examples of inline math are $\alpha = \sqrt{\gamma^2 + \Gamma^2}$ and $\vec{v} = 7 \hat{x} - 5 \hat{y}$ and $\vec u \times \vec v$ and $c = (2.99 \pm 0.01) \times 10^8$ m/s. One example of block (display) math is
%
\begin{equation}
	\int_0^1x^2 dx = \frac{1}{3},
	\label{myIntegral}
\end{equation}
%
and a second example is
%
\begin{equation}
	\xi = \alpha \left( \frac{1}{ \omega_0^2 + \omega^2 } \right).
	\label{signal}
\end{equation}
%
Note how block math is punctuated like words in a sentence! The block math equations are automatically numbered. We can reference Eq. \ref{myIntegral} or Eq. \ref{signal} by inserting labels in the block, but then we must compile \LaTeX\ twice.

We can readily cite articles \cite{Chenciner2000}  and books \cite{Gleick1987} and URLs \cite{Lindner2015} in our bibliography, but now we must compile \LaTeX, Bib\TeX,  \LaTeX, \LaTeX.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Figures \& Tables}
We can also include figures, but first we need to use package ``graphicx" under document class. We can reference Fig. \ref{SchematicDiagram} like equations. All figures should have captions.

\begin{figure}[ht] % "ht" = here or top
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Figures/ExampleFigure} % For Mac OS X PDFs (else append .eps)
		\caption{Figure captions go on bottom.}
		\label{SchematicDiagram}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can also include tables, such as Table \ref{demoTable}. Like figures, we can also \emph{attempt} to force their positions. 

In the document class line, we can easily convert from ``preprint" one-column, double-spacing for rough drafts to ``twocolumn" single spacing for final drafts!

\begin{table}[h] % indenting is optional	
	\caption{Table captions go on top.}
	\label{demoTable}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{cc} % "cc" = center each column
			absicssa & ordinate\\
			\hline
			1.0 s & 5.6 m\\
			2.0 s & 6.7 m\\
			3.0 s & 9.9 m
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
